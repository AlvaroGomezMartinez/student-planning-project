    <p>Draft Steps<br>
        1. Add the pdf batch file to the 'output_folder' in this project's developer's project file folder. Change the name of the file to 'input.pdf'.
        2. Use node to run 'split-student.js'. ```node split-students.js output_folder/input.pdf processed``` The students' individual sections will be extracted from the batch file and added to the 'processed' folder in the developer's project files.
        3. Move the students' pdf files into the 'output_folder' in Google Drive. Verify that the files are correctly named and delete them from the developer's project files.
        4. Run 'Move PDFs in output_folder to Student Folders' from the 'Student Planning' menu.
        5. Verify that the files were moved to student's folder.
        6. Delete the pdf files from the developer's project files.
