# Ignore typical files and folders that should not be pushed to Google Apps Script

# Ignore everything by default, then whitelist the files needed in the Apps Script project.
# This prevents accidental pushing of local node_modules and other development files.

# Whitelist Apps Script manifest and the project source files we want pushed

# Keep the .claspignore itself out of the push (not strictly necessary) and other local files
# (other files remain ignored by the leading '*')
